The shortest distance ever recorded between the two planets is approximately 56 million kilometers, which occurs during close encounters. However, the average distance between Earth and Mars is roughly 225 million kilometers, as they can be much farther apart. \\n\\nWhen Mars is in opposition, which happens approximately every two years, it can be as far as 401 million kilometers from Earth. The vast distances in space make even the closest encounters between Earth and Mars incredibly vast compared to distances on our home planet.'}"
